ThotJS
=================

Build Applications at the speed of thot

## What is it?

ThotJS is a complete fullstack application development platform for node 0.11 and beyond.

Just a few of the items that will be included when the first functionally complete version is released are:

 - Dependency Injection
 - Application Generation
 - Scaffolding
 - Automated Routing
 - Client/Server Data Synchronization
 - Base Build Pipeline
 - Easy to extend/replace any part of the platform
 - Content Negotiation
 - Distributed Servers and Workers
 - Middleware Support
 - Distributed Logging
 - Built-in Profiling and Monitoring
 - API Generation
 - WebSockets Integration
 - Run-time REPL
 - Complete Seperation of Concerns
 - MVC Style Abstractions (it's not strictly MVC as it borrows from other design patterns where appropriate)
 - Easy to Learn
 - 100% Unit Tested
 - Easily Use any Component Without the Rest of the Platform
 - lots lots more.. I'll have a roadmap up as soon as I can so you can see more details

## How do I Install It?

To give ThotJS a try you'll have to wait on me a little longer but essentially what you'll do is install this module
globally and then use it to create a new project including the options you want. While there will be other methods of
 starting an application this will be the simplest at least at the beginning. I do have plans to add a web-based
 generator later on.

## Documentation

Documentation is coming soon... sorry for the delay but this project is a massive undertaking

## Get Involved

If you'd like to get involved with the project for the moment the easiest way will be through github issues.

I'll add better communication methods once I've got a decent base for the application setup.
